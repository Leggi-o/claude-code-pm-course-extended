## 📚 About This Repository

### Original Course Credit

This repository is based on the excellent **Claude Code for Product Managers** course created by Carl Vellotti.

**Original Repository:** https://github.com/carlvellotti/claude-code-pm-course

The original course provides comprehensive, hands-on training for Product Managers to learn Claude Code through real-world scenarios with TaskFlow (a fictional SaaS project management tool). All the core lesson modules, teaching scripts, and company context materials are from Carl's original work.

### What's Been Added

This extended version includes a **Quick reference guides/** folder with three comprehensive reference documents created during course completion:

1. **Level-1-Reference-Guide.md** - Complete reference covering Modules 1.1-1.3:
  - Course overview and TaskFlow context
  - Visual workspace setup techniques
  - File operations and @ reference syntax
  - Communication style templates
  - Image analysis best practices (including the critical Ctrl+V tip!)
  - Common PM workflows and patterns
  - Time savings summary

2. **Solutions-Research.md** - Design pattern solutions for TaskFlow user pain points:
  - 5 comprehensive design patterns (Empty State Design, Template Gallery, Digest Mode Notifications, Progressive Disclosure Onboarding, Sample Data Pre-population)
  - Real-world examples from Asana, Notion, Linear, GitHub, Stripe
  - Implementation details and effort estimates
  - Technical considerations
  - Competitive analysis
  - Success metrics
  - All sources from web search research

3. **research-communications.md** - Example of multi-format communication:
  - Slack Update format (casual, team-focused)
  - Executive Email format (strategic, business-impact)
  - Notion Document format (comprehensive, detailed)
  - Demonstrates communication style transformation using user research synthesis

These reference guides serve as quick-access resources for common Claude Code patterns and PM workflows learned throughout the course. They complement the original interactive teaching modules by providing standalone documentation you can reference anytime.

### How to Use This Repository
