## Recommendation: BUILD THE MOBILE APP (Critical Priority)

Every data source points to the same conclusion: a native mobile app is not optional — it's a business-critical requirement for retention, growth, and competitive positioning.

## Pain Points Across All Sources

| Pain Point | Interviews | Survey | Support | Sales |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No native mobile app | 5/5 users | 100% demand | 10/10 tickets | 5 lost deals |
| Poor mobile web performance | "Painfully slow" | 2.0/5 satisfaction | 30+ sec load times | "They laughed" |
| No offline access | "Screenshotting boards" | 7+ mentions | Field teams abandoned tool | Dealbreaker for 80% |
| No push notifications | Missed urgent updates | 8+ mentions | Frequent logouts | Enterprise expectation |

## Demand Data

- **User Interviews:** 5/5 interviewees (100%) named mobile as essential
- **Survey:** 200/200 respondents (100%) want a native app
- **Support:** 10/10 tickets are mobile-related; $420K ARR at risk
- **Sales:** $466K ARR lost to competitors; $515K ARR at risk of churning

**Total revenue impact: ~$1.4M** ($466K lost + $515K at risk + $420K support-flagged)

## Final Recommendation

**Ship mobile MVP by January 31, 2025** (aligns with current roadmap). Prioritize offline sync, push notifications, and core task management. Address Precision Manufacturing's December 1st deadline with a committed roadmap. This is the single highest-impact initiative for revenue retention and growth.
