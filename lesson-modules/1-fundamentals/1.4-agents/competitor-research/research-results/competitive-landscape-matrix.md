## Positioning Map

| Competitor | Primary Audience | Core Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **TaskFlow** | Remote cross-functional teams | "PM built for how remote teams actually work" |
| **Asana** | Enterprise, large orgs | "Work management for teams of all sizes" |
| **Linear** | Engineering/dev teams | "Modern issue tracker for software teams" |
| **Monday.com** | Mid-market, visual thinkers | "Flexible work management platform" |
| **ClickUp** | Teams consolidating tools | "One app to replace them all" |
| **Jira** | Software development teams | "Agile project management for dev teams" |

## Key Opportunities for TaskFlow

### 1. Own the "Remote-First" Category
No competitor is purpose-built for async, remote teams. This is a wide-open positioning opportunity. TaskFlow's async-first philosophy is a genuine differentiator.

### 2. Win the Simplicity Battle
Asana, ClickUp, Monday.com, and Jira all suffer from complexity and bloat. Teams are churning from these tools because they're too complicated. TaskFlow's clean, focused approach is a strength.

### 3. Mobile + Offline as a Wedge
TaskFlow's upcoming mobile app with offline sync is a feature no competitor does well. This is a strong differentiator for field teams and remote workers in varied connectivity.

### 4. Price Competitively in the Mid-Market
The new Business tier ($18/user) undercuts Asana Advanced ($24.99) and Monday Pro ($19) while offering enterprise-lite features. ClickUp and Linear are cheaper but lack TaskFlow's remote-first focus.

## Threats to Watch

- **Asana's AI investment** — AI Teammates could justify their premium pricing
- **Monday.com's marketing spend** — 10x our budget, winning mindshare
- **Linear's expansion** — Moving beyond engineering into cross-functional use cases
- **ClickUp's pricing** — Extremely aggressive, hard to beat on features-per-dollar
