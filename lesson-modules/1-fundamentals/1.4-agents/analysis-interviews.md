## Key Mobile Pain Points

### 1. **Speed & Performance** (High Intensity)
- **Marcus (Engineering Manager):** "Mobile web experience is... functional, but painfully slow. Loading a board takes forever on cellular."
- **James (Operations):** "Mobile web takes so long to load that I just call the person instead. We've reverted to phone calls because the tool is too slow."
- Impact: Users abandon mobile access, reverting to slower workarounds

### 2. **Offline Access** (Critical Intensity)
- **Priya (Product Manager, frequent traveler):** "I'm on planes probably twice a week...TaskFlow mobile web is unusable offline."
- **Priya's workaround:** "I've started screenshotting my board before flights. It's embarrassing."
- Impact: Power users lose 4-6 hours weekly of potential productivity

### 3. **Lack of Push Notifications** (High Intensity)
- **Rachel (Design Lead):** "I have Slack notifications, email notifications, but no TaskFlow notifications on mobile...I find out about urgent comments through Slack instead."
- Impact: Important updates get missed or routed through alternative channels

### 4. **Real-time Collaboration Gap** (Moderate-High Intensity)
- **David (Founder, constant mobile user):** "My team updates tasks throughout the day. If I can't see those updates until 7pm, I'm making decisions with stale information."
- **James:** Team of 15, but "Maybe 5 sit at desks regularly...they've basically stopped using TaskFlow because there's no good mobile option."

## User Contexts Requiring Mobile Access

1. **In-transit scenarios:** Commutes (subway), flights, between meetings
2. **On-the-job field work:** Operations staff in warehouses/server rooms, founders between investor meetings
3. **Standup meetings:** Quick status checks while away from desk
4. **Design review scenarios:** Stakeholders asking for status in real-time
5. **Decision-making:** Founders/managers need real-time visibility regardless of location

## Emotional Intensity: CRITICAL

- **David:** Bought $800 iPad as workaround - "That's insane"
- **Priya:** "It's becoming a reputation thing" (within design community)
- **James:** Explicit renewal risk - "Mobile will be a requirement...If you don't have it, we'll evaluate alternatives. Full stop."
- **Marcus:** "I'd push for us to upgrade to whatever tier includes it"

## Summary

All 5 interviewees named mobile as essential to their workflow. Pain points cluster around **performance, offline access, and notifications**. Revenue at risk: users willing to pay 2-3x monthly fees for functional mobile app. Competitive pressure high - Linear and Asana already winning on mobile experience.
