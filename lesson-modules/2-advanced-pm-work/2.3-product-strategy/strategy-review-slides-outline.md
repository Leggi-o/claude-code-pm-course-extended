**Format:** Executive Presentation (13 slides)
**Audience:** CEO, CTO, Head of Product
**Duration:** ~20 minutes presentation + 10 minutes Q&A

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Title:** TaskFlow H1 2026 AI Product Strategy

**Subtitle:** Gen AI PM • February 2026

---

## Slide 2: Executive Summary

**Key Points:**
- Strategic Bet: Become an AI-native productivity platform for SMB teams
- Partner with OpenAI/Google for foundational AI capabilities
- Focus 2-person team (expanding to 4-5) on TaskFlow-specific workflows
- Bundle AI into premium tier ($18/user/month) with trial access
- Ship focused set of exceptional AI features with rapid iteration
- H1 2026: AI-native UI + 2 core workflows (task breakdown, real-time integration)

**Visual:** Consider adding a simple diagram showing "Partner AI + TaskFlow Workflows = AI-Native Platform"

## Slide 3: The Strategic Challenge (Diagnosis)

**Key Points:**
- Everyone has AI, but no one has won yet
- **Notion:** Trapped in walled garden, can't access real-time external data
- **Linear:** Only serves dev teams, narrow market
- **Asana:** Enterprise focus, reputation crisis, complex implementation
- **Gap:** Real-time integration, SMB-focused AI, operational automation
- **TaskFlow's advantage:** SMB market (5-20 teams) underserved by competitors

**Visual:** Icons or simple graphics for each competitor showing their strengths/weaknesses

## Slide 4: Competitive Landscape

**Table Format:**

| Competitor | Strong At | Weak At | Whitespace |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Notion** | Knowledge work<br>20M users | Walled garden<br>No real-time data | Integration |
| **Linear** | Dev teams<br>Triage AI | Only engineering<br>Narrow market | Cross-functional |
| **Asana** | Enterprise<br>98% adoption | Poor support<br>Complex setup | SMB simplicity |
| **TaskFlow** | SMB focused<br>Simple & fast | Limited AI<br>Small team | AI-native SMB |

**Insight:** Clear whitespace in AI-native experience for SMB cross-functional teams

---

## Slide 5: Our Strategic Direction (Guiding Policy)

**Our 5 Strategic Choices:**

1. **PARTNER** for AI capabilities (OpenAI/Google) - don't build from scratch
2. **STICK** to our roadmap - don't chase every competitor move
3. **BUNDLE** AI into premium tier ($18/user) with trial access
4. **REBUILD** as AI-native experience (not AI bolted on)
5. **FOCUS** on core features with rapid iteration (ship early, iterate fast)

**Visual:** Numbered list with icons or simple graphics for each choice

---

## Slide 6: Strategic Tradeoffs - What We're NOT Doing

**Key Points:**
- ❌ NOT building foundational AI ourselves → We partner instead
- ❌ NOT chasing every competitor feature → We stick to our roadmap
- ❌ NOT targeting enterprise → We focus on SMBs (5-20 person teams)
- ❌ NOT spreading AI everywhere thinly → We focus on core workflows
- ❌ NOT moving slow in the name of quality → Ship early and iterate

**Callout:** Real strategy involves saying NO to create focus and advantage

**Visual:** Red X icons or strikethrough text to emphasize what we're NOT doing

## Slide 10: Critical Assumptions to Validate

**Key Assumptions:**

1. **OpenAI/Google APIs sufficient** for our use cases (<$3/user cost)
   - Validation: Q1 beta testing, cost monitoring

2. **Can hire 2-3 AI engineers in Q1** (competitive market)
   - Validation: Hiring pipeline, offers by Week 4

3. **Users embrace AI-native experience** (beta NPS >40, <10% downgrade)
   - Validation: Beta feedback, churn monitoring

4. **Premium pricing ($18/user) converts 40%** of trial users
   - Validation: Q2 conversion tracking

5. **AI-native + real-time integration** is defensible differentiation
   - Validation: User feedback on "why TaskFlow"

6. **$50k/quarter AI budget** sufficient for 2,000+ customers
   - Validation: Q1 cost monitoring

**Callout:** Each assumption has validation plan and risk mitigation

## Slide 12: Top Risks & Mitigation Strategies

**Table Format:**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Customers reject AI-native pivot** | High (20-30% churn) | Phased rollout, classic mode fallback, grandfather pricing for 6 months |
| **Partner API limitations/costs** | High (strategy depends on APIs) | Multi-provider strategy, usage optimization, usage-based pricing backstop |
| **Can't hire fast enough** | Medium (roadmap slips) | Start immediately, remote-first hiring, reduce scope if needed |
| **Competitors match features** | Medium (reduced differentiation) | Focus on execution speed, network effects, vertical AI |
| **AI hype fades** | Low-Medium (strategy misaligned) | Focus on productivity gains, measure ROI, core product still works without AI |

**Visual:** Risk matrix (likelihood vs impact) or traffic light indicators for each risk

## Presentation Notes

**Opening (2 minutes):**
- Set context: AI is becoming table stakes, we're at an inflection point
- Thesis: We can win by being AI-native for SMBs, not by out-resourcing large competitors

**Diagnosis (3 minutes):**
- Walk through competitive landscape
- Emphasize the gap: no one serving SMBs with AI-native experience

**Strategy (5 minutes):**
- Explain the 5 strategic choices and why they're coherent
- Emphasize the tradeoffs - what we're NOT doing matters as much as what we ARE doing

**Roadmap (5 minutes):**
- Q1 focus: foundation and first core workflow
- Q2 focus: scale and second core workflow
- Highlight the sequence and dependencies

**Risk & Ask (3 minutes):**
- Be honest about risks and show mitigation plans
- Clear asks with specific budget and hiring numbers

**Q&A (10 minutes):**
- Anticipated questions:
  - "What if OpenAI raises prices?" → Multi-provider strategy
  - "What about enterprise?" → Not our focus, but could revisit in H2
  - "Why only 2 core workflows?" → Quality over quantity, rapid iteration
  - "What if users hate the new UI?" → Classic mode fallback, phased rollout
