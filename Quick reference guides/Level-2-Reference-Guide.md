### Key Workflows (Module 2.2)

**1. Problem Discovery Workflow**
```
Read funnel data → Identify drop-off points → Read qualitative data →
Extract themes → Synthesize insights → Create problem analysis doc
```

**2. Impact Estimation Workflow**
```
Define users affected → Calculate current baseline → Estimate lift →
Calculate value per action → Model scenarios → Build ROI model
```

**3. Experiment Analysis Workflow**
```
Analyze topline results → Segment by target customer →
Analyze quality metrics → Check leading indicators →
Make segment-specific recommendation
```

### Deliverables Created (Module 2.2)

**Example documents from TaskFlow activation case:**
- `activation-problem-analysis.md` - Problem validation with funnel + survey data
- `guided-onboarding-roi-scenarios.md` - Three-scenario business case
- `guided-onboarding-experiment-readout.md` - Full A/B test analysis with segment-specific recommendation

### Critical Lessons Learned

**🎯 Always Segment Before Deciding**
- Topline metrics can hide massive wins (or losses) in specific segments
- Example: +2.6pp topline hid +10.75pp lift for target segment
- Always analyze your target customer segment separately

**📊 Quality Metrics Matter as Much as Quantity**
- Don't just measure if users activate - measure how engaged they are
- Track retention, engagement, template usage, invites
- Quality metrics predict long-term value

**🔢 Multi-Scenario Planning Reduces Risk**
- Single-point estimates are dangerous (hide uncertainty)
- Three scenarios show range of outcomes (pessimistic/realistic/optimistic)
- Helps leadership understand risk/reward trade-offs

- Coherent Actions: Specific, coordinated steps that reinforce each other

✅ **Making Strategic Tradeoffs**
- Understanding that strategy is about choices (saying YES to some things, NO to others)
- Using devil's advocate to pressure-test strategic decisions
- Recognizing that all strategic choices have tradeoffs

✅ **Competitive Research for Strategy**
- Using parallel agents to research competitive landscape quickly

✅ **Strategy → Execution**
- Translating strategic choices into coherent roadmap
- Using skills (pptx) to transform strategy docs into executive presentations
- Creating defensible, well-reasoned strategic direction

### Rumelt's Strategy Kernel

**Framework:** From "Good Strategy, Bad Strategy" by Richard Rumelt

This framework has three essential parts that form the core of any solid strategy:

**1. DIAGNOSIS - "What's really going on here?"**
- Identifies the core challenge or opportunity
- Based on real data and competitive landscape
- Cuts through complexity to the essential issue
- Example: "AI is becoming table stakes, but no one has won yet. With limited resources, where can we uniquely win?"

**2. GUIDING POLICY - "What's our approach?"**
- Makes hard choices about WHERE to compete and HOW to win
- Says NO to some opportunities to focus on others
- Creates advantage through tradeoffs
- Example: "Focus on voice AI for SMBs, NOT enterprise; NOT spreading AI everywhere"

**3. COHERENT ACTIONS - "How do we execute?"**
- Specific initiatives that reinforce each other
- Sequenced roadmap with clear dependencies
- Resources focused on the strategy
- Example: "Q1: Expand voice to meetings, Q2: Add voice collaboration features"

**Why This Matters:**
Most "strategies" are just lists of goals ("grow 50%!") or features ("build everything!"). Real strategy involves:
- **Choices** about where to compete
- **Tradeoffs** about what NOT to do
- **Focus** on actions that reinforce each other

**Red Flags (Bad Strategy):**
- ❌ Goals masquerading as strategy ("be the best", "delight customers")
- ❌ No real tradeoffs made ("we'll do everything for everyone")
- ❌ Laundry list of initiatives that don't reinforce each other
- ❌ Wishful thinking without advantage ("we'll out-innovate competitors")

### Key Workflows (Module 2.3)

**Strategic Development Workflow**

**Step 1: Competitive Research**
```bash
# Use parallel agents to research competitors
"Spin up 3 agents to research Notion, Linear, and Asana's AI strategies"

# Each agent researches:
# - What AI features they've launched
# - How they position/price AI
# - What's working vs not working
# - Where there might be whitespace
```

**Step 2: Diagnosis (Understand the Challenge)**
```bash
# Synthesize competitive research
"Based on competitor research, what's the strategic challenge for TaskFlow's AI?"

# Consider constraints
"What are our team/budget/capability constraints?"

# Identify the core opportunity
"Where can we uniquely win with limited resources?"
```

**Step 3: Make Strategic Choices (Guiding Policy)**

Make 5 key strategic choices, each with tradeoffs:
1. **Focus vs Breadth** - Go deep on one capability or spread AI everywhere?
2. **Competitive Response** - Race to catch up or differentiate differently?
3. **Business Model** - Premium tier, subsidize, or usage-based pricing?
4. **Product Scope** - AI as the product, enhancement, or specific tools?
5. **Risk Tolerance** - Move fast, be deliberate, or wait and learn?

For each choice:
- **Choose A, B, or C** (each option has different tradeoffs)
- **Face devil's advocate challenge** (pressure-test your thinking)
- **Stick or reconsider** (refine based on challenge)

**Step 4: Synthesize Strategy Document**
```bash
# Create complete strategy using Rumelt's Kernel
"Synthesize my 5 strategic choices into a complete strategy document"

# Output structure:
# - DIAGNOSIS: The strategic challenge
# - GUIDING POLICY: Our strategic approach (from 5 choices)
# - COHERENT ACTIONS: H1 2026 roadmap aligned with choices
# - CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS: What needs to be true?
# - COMPETITIVE POSITIONING: Why we'll win
```

**Step 5: Create Executive Presentation**
```bash
# Use pptx skill to transform strategy into slides
/pptx "Create executive presentation from h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md"

# Generates:
# - 12-15 professional slides
# - Charts, graphs, visual elements
# - Ready for leadership review
```

### Critical Lessons Learned

**🎯 Strategy Is About Choices, Not Goals**
- "Grow 50%" is a goal, not a strategy
- "Focus on voice AI for SMBs, exclude enterprise" is strategy
- Real strategy says NO to things to create focus

**🤔 Use Devil's Advocate to Pressure-Test**
- Challenge every strategic choice with tough questions
- Better to hear hard questions from AI than from your CEO
- Refine thinking before sharing with stakeholders

**🔗 Actions Must Be Coherent**
- Each initiative should reinforce the others
- Laundry lists of features ≠ strategy
- Sequencing matters (what comes first, what depends on what)

**📊 Competitive Research Informs Diagnosis**
- Use parallel agents to research 3-5 competitors quickly
- Identify what's commoditizing vs differentiated
- Find whitespace where you can uniquely win

**🎤 Transform Strategy → Presentation with Skills**
- Use /pptx to convert strategy docs to executive slides
- Skills extend Claude Code beyond conversation
- Professional deliverables ready for stakeholder review

### Deliverables Created (Module 2.3)

**Example documents from TaskFlow AI strategy:**
- `h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md` - Complete AI product strategy using Rumelt's Strategy Kernel
- `strategy-review-slides.pptx` - 13-slide executive presentation with tables, timelines, and competitive analysis
- `strategy-review-slides-outline.md` - Detailed presentation outline with speaker notes

**Strategic Framework Applied:**
- **DIAGNOSIS:** AI landscape analysis (Notion, Linear, Asana) revealing competitive gaps and whitespace
- **GUIDING POLICY:** 5 strategic choices synthesized into coherent approach (Partner for AI, Stick to roadmap, Bundle pricing, AI-native rebuild, Focus + iteration)
- **COHERENT ACTIONS:** H1 2026 roadmap (Q1: Foundation with partner integration and AI-native UI beta; Q2: Scale with GA launch and real-time integration)

### The 5 Strategic Choices Framework

When developing product strategy, make decisions across these 5 dimensions:

**Choice #1: Focus vs Breadth**
- A) Go deep on one capability as differentiator
- B) Spread capabilities everywhere
- C) Partner for capabilities, focus on integration

**Choice #2: Competitive Response**
- A) Build faster/better to out-innovate
- B) Differentiate differently (serve different segment/use case)
- C) Ignore and focus on your unique roadmap

**Choice #3: Business Model**
- A) Premium tier (protect margins)
- B) Subsidize to drive adoption
- C) Usage-based (align costs with value)

**Choice #4: Product Scope**
- A) Capability as the product (rebuild around it)
- B) Capability as enhancement (improve existing)
- C) Capability for specific jobs (focused tools)

**Choice #5: Risk Tolerance**
- A) Move fast, take risks (speed over polish)
- B) Deliberate and defensible (quality over speed)
- C) Wait and learn (fast follower)

**How to Use:**
1. Make initial choice for each dimension
2. Apply devil's advocate challenge to each choice
3. Stick with choice or reconsider based on challenge
4. Synthesize final choices into coherent strategy
5. Check: Do your 5 choices reinforce each other?

### Devil's Advocate Technique

**Purpose:** Pressure-test strategic thinking before presenting to stakeholders

**How It Works:**
1. Make a strategic choice
2. AI plays devil's advocate with tough challenge questions:
  - "What if your assumption is wrong?"
  - "What about this alternative perspective?"
  - "How do you address this risk?"
3. Defend your choice or reconsider
4. Results in more robust, defensible strategy

**Example Devil's Advocate Challenges:**
- **Choice: Go deep on voice** → "What if voice becomes commoditized in 6 months?"
- **Choice: SMB focus** → "By excluding enterprise, aren't you giving up where the money is?"
- **Choice: Premium pricing** → "Users won't pay for AI they haven't tried, creating chicken-and-egg problem"
- **Choice: AI as product** → "Rebuilding with 2-person team while competitors keep shipping?"
- **Choice: Move fast** → "Shipping experimental features creates confusing user experience"

**Key Insight:** Better to hear hard questions from AI than blindsided by your CEO or board

### Gibson Biddle's DHM Model

**Framework:** From Gibson Biddle, former VP Product at Netflix

DHM stands for **Delight**, **Hard to Copy**, and **Margin-enhancing**. It's a framework for evaluating product strategy to ensure strategies are not only loved by customers, but also defensible and economically viable.

**A strong product strategy scores well on ALL THREE dimensions.** Weak strategies might delight customers but aren't defensible or don't improve the business model.

#### The Three Dimensions

**D = DELIGHT**
- Does this solve a meaningful customer problem?
- Is the solution significantly better than alternatives?
- Will customers love it (not just tolerate it)?
- Would customers be upset if you removed it?

**Testing for Delight:**
- Customer satisfaction scores and NPS
- Usage metrics and retention
- Qualitative feedback ("I love this!")

**Example:** Netflix Recommendations delight users by helping them discover content they'll love from a massive catalog, reducing decision paralysis with personalized suggestions.

**H = HARD TO COPY**
- What makes this defensible?
- Why can't competitors easily replicate it?

**Types of Defensibility:**
- Network effects (value increases with more users)
- Data moats (proprietary data improves the product)
- Technical complexity (hard engineering problems)
- Ecosystem lock-in (integration makes switching costly)
- Brand & trust (reputation takes years to build)
- Cost structure (economies of scale)

**Example:** Netflix Recommendations are hard to copy because they require massive viewing data + years of algorithm development + human content tagging. Competitors starting today would be years behind.

**M = MARGIN-ENHANCING**
- Does this improve our business model and unit economics?

**Ways to Enhance Margin:**
- Increase revenue (higher prices, upsell/cross-sell, new revenue streams)
- Reduce costs (automation, efficiency, lower CAC, reduced support)
- Improve retention (higher LTV, reduced churn, habit formation)
- Enable premium positioning (justify higher prices)

**Example:** Netflix Recommendations are margin-enhancing by increasing content utilization, improving retention, and reducing marketing costs (discovery is built-in vs. promoting specific titles).

#### How to Use DHM

**Step 1: Score Your Strategy**
Rate each dimension (High/Medium/Low):

| Strategy | Delight | Hard to Copy | Margin-Enhancing | Assessment |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| A | High | Low | Medium | Vulnerable - easy to copy |
| B | High | High | Low | Unsustainable - burns cash |
| C | Low | High | High | No PMF - customers don't care |
| **Ideal** | **High** | **High** | **High** | **Strong strategy** |

**Step 2: Identify Gaps**
Where is your strategy weakest? That's where you need to focus.

**Step 3: Improve Your Strategy**
For each low-scoring dimension:
- **Low Delight?** Do we really understand the customer problem? Is our solution 10x better?
- **Low Hard to Copy?** What moat can we build? What gets stronger over time?
- **Low Margin-Enhancing?** How does this improve unit economics? What's the business model?

**Step 4: Pressure-Test with Competitors**
How would competitors score on DHM? Where are they weak? That's your opportunity.

#### Common Mistakes

❌ **Focusing Only on Delight** - Building features customers love but that don't improve business model or create defensibility
❌ **Pursuing "Hard to Copy" Without Delight** - Building technical moats customers don't care about
❌ **Margin-Enhancing at Expense of Delight** - Optimizing for revenue extraction at cost of customer experience
❌ **Copying Competitors** - Just because competitor has a feature doesn't mean it scores well on DHM for YOUR business
❌ **Overestimating Defensibility** - Thinking "we'll move fast" or "it's complex to build" makes something hard to copy

#### DHM + Other Frameworks

**DHM + Rumelt's Kernel:**
- **Diagnosis** should reveal where you can win on DHM
- **Guiding Policy** should state which dimension(s) you're optimizing for
- **Coherent Actions** should strengthen multiple DHM dimensions

**DHM + SWOT:**
- **Strengths** = Existing advantages in H (Hard to Copy)
- **Opportunities** = Where you can improve D, H, or M
- **Weaknesses** = Low scores on DHM dimensions
- **Threats** = Competitors with better DHM scores

#### Quick DHM Checklist

**DELIGHT**
- [ ] Does this solve a real, painful problem?
- [ ] Is our solution 10x better than alternatives?
- [ ] Do we have evidence customers will love this?
- [ ] Would customers be upset if we removed it?

**HARD TO COPY**
- [ ] What prevents competitors from copying this quickly?
- [ ] Do we have a durable advantage (network effects, data, brand, etc.)?
- [ ] What gets stronger over time?
- [ ] Is our moat real or wishful thinking?

**MARGIN-ENHANCING**
- [ ] Does this increase revenue or reduce costs?
- [ ] Will this improve retention/LTV?
- [ ] What's the ROI on building this?
- [ ] Does this improve our unit economics?

**If you can't check most boxes, rethink your strategy.**

**Remember:** A strong product strategy scores high on ALL THREE dimensions. Delight alone isn't enough - you need defensibility and sound economics.

### SWOT Analysis

**Framework:** Classic strategic planning tool

SWOT stands for **Strengths**, **Weaknesses**, **Opportunities**, and **Threats**. It helps you understand your position and identify strategic options by analyzing internal and external factors.

```
INTERNAL (Things you control)
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│   STRENGTHS     │   WEAKNESSES    │
│  (Helpful)      │   (Harmful)     │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ OPPORTUNITIES   │    THREATS      │
│  (Helpful)      │   (Harmful)     │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
EXTERNAL (Things you don't control)
```

#### The Four Quadrants

**STRENGTHS (Internal, Helpful)**
- What advantages do we have?
- What are we good at?

**What to Look For:**
- Unique capabilities or expertise
- Strong brand or reputation
- Proprietary technology or data
- Existing customer relationships
- Financial resources
- Talented team
- Network effects or installed base
- Efficient operations

**How to Use:** Strengths are the foundation of your strategy. Your guiding policy should leverage these advantages.

**WEAKNESSES (Internal, Harmful)**
- What limitations do we have?
- Where are we vulnerable?

**What to Look For:**
- Limited resources (budget, team size)
- Technical debt or infrastructure constraints
- Gaps in expertise
- Brand perception issues
- Customer churn problems
- Dependency on single platform/partner
- Slow execution
- Weak go-to-market capability

**How to Use:** Weaknesses constrain your strategic options. Be honest about what you CAN'T do. Don't choose a strategy that requires strengths you don't have.

**OPPORTUNITIES (External, Helpful)**
- What trends or changes create opportunities for us?

**What to Look For:**
- Market trends favoring your approach
- Technology shifts (e.g., AI, mobile, voice)
- Customer behavior changes
- Competitors' missteps
- Regulatory changes
- Underserved customer segments
- Adjacent markets to expand into
- Partnership opportunities

**How to Use:** Opportunities are your "where to play" options. Pick opportunities that align with your strengths and can overcome weaknesses.

**THREATS (External, Harmful)**
- What external factors could hurt us?

**What to Look For:**
- New competitors entering the market
- Existing competitors launching similar features
- Technology shifts making your approach obsolete
- Customer preference changes
- Economic downturn affecting budget
- Platform risk (dependency on Google, Apple, etc.)
- Regulatory changes
- Market saturation

**How to Use:** Threats shape your strategic urgency and defensibility needs. Identify which threats are most critical and how to mitigate them.

#### How to Conduct SWOT Analysis

**Step 1: Gather Information**
Collect before filling out SWOT:
- Customer research (what they love/hate)
- Competitive analysis (where you stand vs competitors)
- Market trends (what's changing in your space)
- Internal metrics (what your data shows)
- Team input (what people on the ground see)

**Step 2: Brainstorm Each Quadrant**
Generate 5-10 items per quadrant. Be specific, not generic.

❌ Generic: "Good team"
✅ Specific: "3 engineers with deep expertise in real-time collaboration"

❌ Generic: "Competition"
✅ Specific: "Notion launching AI features Q2, with 10x our marketing budget"

**Step 3: Prioritize**
Mark 2-3 items per quadrant as **critical** (most strategic).

**Step 4: Connect the Dots**
Real insight comes from combining quadrants:

- **Strength + Opportunity = Strategic Bet** ("We're great at X, and market is moving toward Y. Let's double down.")
- **Weakness + Threat = Major Risk** ("We're weak at X, and competitors are attacking there. We need to defend or exit.")
- **Strength + Threat = Defensive Play** ("We have advantage X, but threat Y could erode it. How do we protect?")
- **Weakness + Opportunity = Build or Partner** ("There's big opportunity in X, but we lack capability Y. Do we build it or partner?")

**Step 5: Develop Strategic Options**
Based on SWOT, identify 2-4 strategic directions:

**Example Strategies:**
1. **Leverage Strength + Seize Opportunity** - "We're strong with SMBs (strength), AI is making tools more accessible (opportunity) → Build AI-first SMB product"
2. **Shore Up Weakness + Defend Against Threat** - "We lack mobile (weakness), competitors are mobile-first (threat) → Ship mobile app to defend position"
3. **Avoid Weakness + Ignore Opportunity** - "Enterprise opportunity exists but we're weak there → Stay focused on SMB instead"

#### SWOT Best Practices

**Do's ✅**
- **Be Honest** - Don't sugarcoat weaknesses or overstate strengths
- **Be Specific** - "Strong user retention (Week 1: 78%)" not "Good product"
- **Use Data** - Support with metrics, research, evidence (not just gut feelings)
- **Consider Relative Position** - Strengths/weaknesses are RELATIVE to competitors
- **Update Regularly** - SWOT changes as market evolves; revisit quarterly

**Don'ts ❌**
- **Don't Create a Laundry List** - Prioritize the critical few
- **Don't Confuse Internal with External** - Strengths/Weaknesses = YOU (internal); Opportunities/Threats = MARKET (external)
- **Don't Stop at the SWOT** - SWOT is diagnostic, not strategy. Use it to inform strategic choices
- **Don't Ignore Bad News** - Weaknesses and threats are the most valuable quadrants
- **Don't Make It Static** - SWOT should lead to action: "So what? What does this mean for our strategy?"

#### SWOT + Other Frameworks

**SWOT + Rumelt's Kernel:**

**SWOT informs your Diagnosis:**
- Critical weaknesses and threats = challenges to overcome
- Critical strengths and opportunities = advantages to leverage

**Example:**
- **Diagnosis:** "We're positioned to win with small teams (strength) in an AI-first world (opportunity), but vulnerable to better-funded competitors (threat) copying our approach unless we build defensibility"
- **Guiding Policy:** "Become the AI-native productivity tool for founder-led companies, winning through superior product-market fit rather than marketing spend"
- **Coherent Actions:** [Roadmap aligned with this]

**SWOT + DHM:**
Use DHM to evaluate strategic options generated by SWOT:

| Option | Delight | Hard to Copy | Margin | Score |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------|-------|
| AI-First | High | Medium | High | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Product-Led | Medium | Low | Medium | ⭐⭐ |
| Mobile-First | Medium | Low | Low | ⭐ |
| Vertical | High | Medium | Medium | ⭐⭐⭐ |

#### Quick SWOT Checklist

**STRENGTHS** (Internal, Helpful)
- [ ] What unique capabilities do we have?
- [ ] What do customers love about us?
- [ ] What advantages vs competitors?

**WEAKNESSES** (Internal, Harmful)
- [ ] What limits our options?
- [ ] Where are we vulnerable?
- [ ] What do we lack vs competitors?

**OPPORTUNITIES** (External, Helpful)
- [ ] What market trends favor us?
- [ ] What customer needs are underserved?
- [ ] Where are competitors weak?

**THREATS** (External, Harmful)
- [ ] What could disrupt our business?
- [ ] What are competitors doing?
- [ ] What external factors create risk?

**Then ask:**
- Which Strength + Opportunity combinations are most promising?
- Which Weakness + Threat combinations are most dangerous?
- What does this tell us about where to compete?

**Remember:** SWOT is a diagnostic tool, not a strategy. Use it to understand your position honestly, identify strategic options, and prioritize where to focus. The best strategies leverage strengths, address weaknesses, seize opportunities, and mitigate threats - all at once.

## Advanced Patterns

### Pattern 1: Research → PRD Pipeline

**Coming soon**

### Pattern 2: Data → Insights → Strategy

**From Raw Data to Actionable Decisions**

**Step 1: Process Raw Data**
- Use Claude to analyze CSV files with thousands of rows
- Extract patterns from qualitative feedback (surveys, interviews)
- Calculate statistical significance and confidence intervals

**Step 2: Generate Insights**
- Identify the "so what?" - why does this data matter?
- Connect quantitative metrics to qualitative user pain points
- Segment by customer type to find hidden patterns

**Step 3: Build Business Case**
- Estimate impact using frameworks
- Model multiple scenarios to show risk/reward
- Calculate ROI with realistic assumptions

**Step 4: Make Recommendation**
- Clear decision based on data (ship/iterate/kill)
- Segment-specific rollout strategy if needed
- Define success metrics for monitoring

**Example: TaskFlow Activation Analysis**
- **Data:** Funnel shows 60% drop-off, survey shows "blank canvas" confusion
- **Insight:** Users need examples, not just empty projects
- **Business Case:** 28.3x ROI over 3 years (realistic scenario)

### PRD Templates

**Location:** `lesson-modules/2-advanced-pm-work/2.1-write-prd/prd-templates/`

You have 4 different PRD templates to choose from, each with different strengths:

#### Quick Comparison Table

| Template | Complexity | Best For | Key Strength |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Lenny's (Original)** | ⭐ Minimal | Small features, experiments, startups | Speed - get ideas on paper fast |
| **Lenny's Enhanced** | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | AI features, complex products | AI-specific sections + monetization |
| **Carl's Template** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Comprehensive | Large features, stakeholder alignment | Problem/solution separation |
| **Tania's Spec Template** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Detailed | FinTech, regulated industries, QA-heavy | Customer feedback + testing focus |

#### Template 1: Lenny's PRD Template (Original)

**Author:** Lenny Rachitsky
**File:** `Lennys-PRD-Template.md`

**Philosophy:** Answer 7 essential questions, nothing more. Optimized for speed and clarity.

**Sections:**
1. Description - What is it?
2. Problem - What problem is this solving?
3. Why - How do we know this is a real problem?
4. Success - How do we know if we've solved it?
5. Audience - Who are we building for?
6. What - What does this look like?
7. How - What is the experiment plan?
8. When - When does it ship?

**Use when:**
- ✅ Small feature or quick experiment
- ✅ Early-stage product or startup
- ✅ Need to move extremely fast
- ✅ Simple problem with clear solution
- ✅ Small team that doesn't need heavy process

**Skip when:**
- ❌ Need to align execs across departments
- ❌ Complex technical implementation
- ❌ AI/ML features with edge cases
- ❌ Regulated industry requiring detailed specs

---

#### Template 2: Lenny's PRD Template - Enhanced

**Author:** Lenny Rachitsky (enhanced version)
**File:** `Lennys-PRD-Template-Enhanced.md`

**Philosophy:** Lenny's minimalist spirit + sections for AI features, monetization, and cross-functional alignment.

**Additional sections beyond original:**
- 🤖 **AI Autonomy & Control** - What AI can/cannot do autonomously, edge cases, user control
- 💰 **Monetization & Business Case** - Pricing tier, revenue model, projected impact
- 📋 **Documentation & Workflow** - Links to Jira, Figma, related docs
- **Changelog** - Track how PRD evolves over time
- **V2 Roadmap Preview** - Future enhancements post-V1

**Use when:**
- ✅ AI-powered features (critical: need autonomy boundaries)
- ✅ Need explicit monetization strategy
- ✅ Integration with Jira/agile workflow
- ✅ Want structured changelog tracking
- ✅ Building for multiple personas with different needs

**Skip when:**
- ❌ Want absolute minimalism (use original Lenny's)
- ❌ No AI components and simple monetization
- ❌ Pre-product-market-fit exploration

---

#### Template 3: Carl's PRD Template

**Author:** Carl (source unknown, popular in tech)
**File:** `Carls-PRD-Template.md`

**Philosophy:** Separate problem alignment from solution alignment. Ensure everyone agrees on the WHY before discussing the HOW.

**Structure:**

**Part 1: Problem Alignment**
- Problem & Opportunity
- High Level Approach
- Narrative (optional customer stories)
- Goals (measurable + immeasurable)
- Non-goals (explicit exclusions)

**Part 2: Solution Alignment**
- Key Features (plan of record + future considerations)
- Key Flows (end-to-end experience)
- Key Logic (rules, edge cases, non-functional requirements)

**Part 3: Development and Launch Planning**
- Key Milestones
- Operational Checklist

**Use when:**
- ✅ Large, complex features
- ✅ Need to align multiple stakeholders (exec, eng, design, sales)
- ✅ Problem space is ambiguous or contested
- ✅ Solution requires significant eng investment
- ✅ Want to separate "what to build" from "how to build it"

**Skip when:**
- ❌ Small, obvious feature
- ❌ Need to move extremely fast
- ❌ Single-person project with no stakeholder alignment needed

---

#### Template 4: Tania's Spec Template

**Author:** Tania (FinTech/Banking context)
**File:** `Tanias-Spec-Template.md`

**Philosophy:** Comprehensive spec optimized for regulated industries, customer-driven development, and QA-heavy workflows.

**Unique sections:**
- **Supporting Data** - Power BI metrics, customer metrics, usage data
- **Customer Feedback** - Structured 2-3 customer conversations with business impact
- **Market Research** - Competitor screenshots and industry insights
- **UX Brief** - Separate from development (Flow, Context, Sketch, Success metrics)
- **UX Tasks Table** - Use Case | User Story | Link to Monday ticket
- **Development Requirements Table** - User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Testing | Link
  - **Testing column** - QA testing notes separate from acceptance criteria
- **Open Questions** - Product needs R&D/Data to answer
- **Risks** - Product, technical, delivery risks
- **Limitations / Requirements** - Version requirements, platform constraints

**Use when:**
- ✅ FinTech, banking, healthcare, or regulated industries
- ✅ Heavy customer co-development (working directly with 2-3 banks/clients)
- ✅ Need explicit testing guidance for QA team
- ✅ Multiple constraints (version requirements, platform limitations)
- ✅ Need to link every requirement to tickets (Monday, Jira, etc.)
- ✅ Require separate UX and development sections

**Skip when:**
- ❌ Consumer product without regulatory requirements
- ❌ Fast-moving startup environment
- ❌ Don't have customer conversations to structure
- ❌ Testing is handled by engineering, not separate QA

#### Choosing the Right Template

**Start here:**

1. **Is this an AI feature?** → Use **Lenny's Enhanced** for AI autonomy sections
2. **Do you work in FinTech/regulated industry?** → Use **Tania's Spec Template**
3. **Is problem alignment critical?** → Use **Carl's Template** to separate problem/solution
4. **Do you need speed above all?** → Use **Lenny's Original**

**Mix and match:**
- You can combine sections from different templates
- Start with a base template and add sections you need
- Example: Carl's structure + Tania's testing column + Lenny's AI sections

**Pro tip:**
- For your first PRD, use Lenny's Original to get comfortable
- As projects get more complex, migrate to Carl's or Enhanced versions
- Keep a "house template" for your team and customize it over time

#### Template Comparison: What's Different?

**Customer Evidence:**
- **Tania's:** Most structured (2-3 customer conversations with business impact)
- **Carl's:** Incorporated into Problem & Opportunity section
- **Lenny's (both):** "Why" section with evidence bullets

**Testing & QA:**
- **Tania's:** Separate Testing column in requirements table (unique!)
- **Carl's:** Key Logic section includes edge cases
- **Lenny's (both):** Minimal - assumes eng/design handle edge cases

**AI Features:**
- **Lenny's Enhanced:** Dedicated AI Autonomy & Control section (unique!)
- **Other templates:** Would need to add AI sections manually

**Stakeholder Alignment:**
- **Carl's:** Best - separates problem vs solution alignment explicitly
- **Tania's:** Strong - structured customer feedback section
- **Lenny's:** Minimal - assumes small team with tight alignment

**Monetization:**
- **Lenny's Enhanced:** Explicit business case section (unique!)
- **Carl's:** Goals section can include revenue goals
- **Tania's:** Business Impact mentioned but not explicit ROI section

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Writing PRDs

**Coming soon after Module 2.1**

### For Data Analysis

**🎯 Always Segment Before Deciding**
- Never stop at topline metrics - they can hide massive wins or losses in specific segments
- Always analyze your target customer segment separately
- Example: +2.6pp topline can hide +10.75pp lift for small teams and -1.25pp for enterprise
- Different segments may need different solutions

**📊 Combine Quantitative + Qualitative Data**
- Quantitative (funnels, metrics) tells you WHAT is happening
- Qualitative (surveys, interviews) tells you WHY it's happening
- Best insights come from synthesizing both
- Example: Funnel shows 60% drop-off (WHAT) + Survey shows "blank canvas confusion" (WHY)

**🔢 Use Multi-Scenario Planning**
- Single-point estimates hide uncertainty and create false precision
- Three scenarios (pessimistic/realistic/optimistic) show range of outcomes
- Helps leadership understand risk/reward trade-offs
- Even pessimistic scenario should justify investment if project is worth doing

**📈 Track Quality Metrics, Not Just Quantity**
- Don't just measure if users activate - measure how engaged they are
- Quality metrics: retention, engagement, feature adoption, invites
- Leading indicators predict long-term success
- Example: Activated users who use templates → higher long-term retention

**⚠️ ROI Calculation Complexity:**
- When calculating multi-year ROI for recurring improvements (e.g., +X users/month), be careful about timeframes
- LTV (Lifetime Value) is collected over 24 months, not immediately
- Year 1 cash collected ≠ Year 1 ARR ≠ Total LTV created in Year 1
- For +455 users/month improvement:
  - Year 1: Add 5,460 total users, but revenue is triangular (Month 1 = 455 users paying, Month 12 = 5,460 users paying)
  - 3-Year: Add 16,380 total users over 36 months (455 × 36)
  - Need to clarify: cash collected vs. LTV created vs. ARR impact

**🔍 Look for Segmentation Patterns**
- Segment by: company size, user role, industry, geography, acquisition channel
- Ask: "Does this feature work better for certain customer types?"
- Ship features to segments where they work, exclude segments where they don't
- One size does NOT fit all
